# CNN-LSTM
A hybrid CNN-LSTM model for stock trend prediction. CNN layers detect short-term chart patterns, while LSTMs capture temporal dependencies. Enhanced with technical indicators, it classifies trends (UP, SIDEWAYS, DOWN) in real time, with ensemble fallback (LSTM, Random Forest) for robustness.
